VM installed as {{ include "kv-single-vm.fullname" . }} in the {{ .Values.vm.namespace }} namespace.

An RDP service has been made available internally on port 3389.

Use the following hostname when adding the VM connection to Guacamole:

{{ include "kv-single-vm.fullname" . }}.{{ .Values.vm.namespace}}.svc.cluster.local

By default, the VM is stopped.
Running `virtcl start {{ include "kv-single-vm.fullname" . }}` will start the VM.
